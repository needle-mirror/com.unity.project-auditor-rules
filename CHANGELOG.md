## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-12

# Changed
* Raised the minimum supported Editor version to 6000.0.
* Removed RoslynAnalyzer label from the Domain_Reload_Analyzer.dll so it does not get auto-included with normal Editor compilation.
* Renamed ObsoleteDatabase.json to ObsoleteDatabase.gen.json to make it more clear that it is a generated file and should not be hand-edited.
* Add Roslyn Analyzers so we can provide code issue detection directly from the package.
* Migrate some analyzers from the built-in module out into the Rules package, so all rules can eventually be defined in this package.
* PAA3001 has been removed. It used to report dependency problems as issues, but this is now covered in the improved dependency viewer starting in Unity 6.6.
* Added PAS0036 to check Fast Enter Playmode settings in 6000.0 and newer.
* Added a new check for modified registry packages.
* Added a new check for 32-bit mesh issues created without an importer.

# Fixed
* Updated Graphics API checks to offer advice based on the preferred order of APIs, rather than simple presence.
* Fixed precision in PAS0017 check: "Time: Maximum Allowed Timestep is set to the default value".
* Fixed Audio Quick Fixers to avoid overwriting settings with defaults.
* Build size analyzers now ignore meta files.
* Fixed the managed stripping analyzer to include the Minimal level on all relevant platforms.
* Ensure all Project Settings issues report a Location.

# Added
